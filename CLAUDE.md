# Subscription Manager

- **Main Feature**: Manages paid subscriptionsâ€”users pay, send screenshots, and unlock tiered features/commands.
- **Demo Bot**: Send a payment screenshot; bot verifies it (manually or via LLM), assigns a tier (e.g., Basic, Pro), and unlocks tier-specific commands like `/pro_feature` for Pro users.
- **Useful Bot**: **Tiered Bot** - Users subscribe by paying and sending proof; Basic tier gets core features (e.g., `/stats`), Pro tier adds advanced ones (e.g., `/analyze` with LLM), all tied to a subscription status in MongoDB.

**Notes**: Verification could be manual or automated (e.g., LLM checks screenshot text for payment details). Commands are gated by tier, keeping it simple and profitable.

## Developer Notes

1) there should be a concept of 'number of tiers' for subscription. default - 1 - just free / subscribed.

2) there should be a concept of free trial - timed.

3) there should be a way to mark a command / feature as available to subscribed members only. for example, a decorator or middleware. Maybe both combined. Middleware will be registered in component dp setup and would check if current user has access to curernt command / feature

4) there should also be a way to limit global message handler (e.g. simple text chat messages) - for example if passing an empty command

5) there should be a payment mechanism. For now - use the same one as done in 146 bot /Users/petrlavrov/work/experiments/register-146-meetup-2025-bot

# Botspot Development Guide

## Build & Test Commands
- Install dependencies: `poetry install`
- Run tests: `poetry run pytest`
- Run single test: `poetry run pytest tests/path_to_test.py::test_function_name -v`
- Format code: `poetry run black .`
- Sort imports: `poetry run isort .`
- Lint code: `poetry run flake8`

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Use isort with black profile; line length 100
- **Formatting**: Black with 100 character line length
- **Types**: Use type hints and Pydantic for data models
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Error Handling**: Use try/except with specific exceptions; logging with loguru
- **Component Usage**: Access components via `deps` object or dedicated getters
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for classes and functions in flake8-docstrings format
- **Dependencies**: Managed with Poetry in pyproject.toml

## Adding New Components
When adding a new component, include:
1. New component file in appropriate subdirectory (main/data/features/middlewares/qol)
2. Add component to config in `core/botspot_settings.py`
3. Add component to `core/dependency_manager.py`
4. Setup component in `core/bot_manager.py`
5. Add getter util to `utils/deps_getters.py` if necessary
6. Create example in `examples/components_examples`

The codebase is a Telegram bot framework with modular components. Prefer composition over inheritance when extending functionality.
