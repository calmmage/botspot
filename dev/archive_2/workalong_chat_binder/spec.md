# Chat Binder

- **Main Feature**: Binds a chat to a user (with an optional key).
- **Demo Bot**: Send `/bind [key]` in a chat; it links the chat to you and echoes "Bound with [key]".
- **Useful Bot**: **Collection Bot** - Binds a chat to a collection, auto-loads messages to a queue, and processes them (e.g., stores or analyzes).

## Developer Notes

Chat binder is already implemented, just need to test that. Next step - integrations.

1) there is a nuance here. This is a very simple but powerful feature. I need to first figure out all the details and work it throgh - create a solid usage examples - and then add documentation everywhere and include it in all my templates. Here are usages I want to have for that feature:

2) bind chat for auto-archiving messages

3) bind chat for all items to be added to a queue - this is our bound_llm_chat component. We can actually make it work without llms - with plain text

4) bind chat for 146 logging. or let's say for dev messages. This is actually should be admin-only feature. And something like that we can have botspot setting, which then, if none, can be specified in runtime by binding... a hidden admin-only command /bind_setting? which would write directly to app.settings or something?

5) what else? What features did I have in mind for this? somehow bind + ingest? I guess that's for /bind_queue component. But yeah, in general, the main idea is to have an easy way to bind a chat and then use that in my app

6) the bot needs admin rights in a bound chat to see all messages - detect and request that.

7) alternatively - use telethon client under the hood.
