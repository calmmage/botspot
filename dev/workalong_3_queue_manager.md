# New Components Workalong

## Current Status

We've implemented the following components:

1. **LLM Provider** ✅ - Basic `query_llm` function with async support.
2. **Queue Manager** ✅ - MongoDB-based queue system with support for multiple queues and queue keys.

## Queue Manager Implementation

I've implemented the Queue Manager component with the following features:

- Generic queue implementation that can store any type of data
- Support for multiple queue collections and queue keys
- Efficient MongoDB indexing for performance
- Methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and removing queue items
- Support for random item retrieval
- Tracking of item metadata (creation time, added by, tags, etc.)
- Queue statistics and operations
- Full async support

## Demo Bot

Created a simple demo bot that:
- Auto-adds any message to the queue
- Provides `/next` to get the next item from the queue
- Provides `/random` to get a random item from the queue
- Provides `/stats` to see queue statistics
- Provides `/clear` to clear the queue
