# Context Builder Implementation Analysis

## Features Added But Not in the Spec

1. `MessageContext` class:
    - Complete class implementation not explicitly specified
    - Methods like `is_expired()`, `get_combined_text()`, `get_full_context()`
    - Tracking of `media_descriptions` as a separate list
    - Tracking of individual messages in the `messages` list

2. Settings that weren't explicitly specified:
    - `include_text` setting (defaulted to True)
    - `include_media` setting (defaulted to True)
    - `include_replies` setting (defaulted to True)
    - `include_forwards` setting (defaulted to True)

3. Context building details not specified:
    - Handling of different media types (photo, video, voice, audio, document)
    - Structure of media descriptions in the context
    - The separation of text content with double newlines

4. `is_in_context_bundle` data flag to indicate that a message is part of a context bundle

5. Example implementation details:
    - Use of ParseMode.HTML in the example bot
    - Additional sleep in message handler to ensure all messages are processed

## Features from Spec Not Implemented

1. **Context for forwarded messages specifically**: The spec mentions "Collects multiple messages forwarded together" and "Forward any messages to the bot", but the implementation doesn't distinguish between forwarded messages and regular messages - it bundles all messages regardless of whether they're forwarded.

2. **Transcription of audio**: The spec mentions "transcription of audio", but the implementation only adds a placeholder "[Voice Message]" or "[Audio]" without actual transcription.

3. **Special handling for replies**: While reply handling is mentioned in settings, there's no special logic to handle reply context differently.

4. **Advanced media handling**: The specification mentions "How to include media" but implementation is basic with just simple placeholders.

5. **Blog post construction example**: The spec mentions "A demo bot could be like get multiple messages with images -> construct a blog post" but this kind of advanced example is not implemented.

6. **No use of reference implementation**: The spec mentions a reference implementation at "/Users/petrlavrov/work/archive/forwarder-bot" but this wasn't referenced or used.

7. **Configurable context building**: The spec mentions "configurable by settings which describes whether to include in the final context things like reply, forward, transcription of audio etc." While settings exist, they don't actually modify the context building behavior.
