1) It seems... I am unable to do even such a simple feature as a database...


2) Ok, what do I need to do?
   a) settings for a working db
   b) save it in deps
   c) initialise somehow - load the ... mongodb

- [ ] find an old working example I had somewhere...

ah, indeed.

ok, now I need a basic example bots.

Let's have separate database example and user_data example

database example should have a simple router with a feature to add, get, get_all items.
